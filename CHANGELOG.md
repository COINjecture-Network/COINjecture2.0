# Changelog

All notable changes to COINjecture Network B will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [4.6.0] - 2025-11-19

### Added
- Privacy-preserving marketplace with ZK commitment scheme
- Public and private problem submission modes (`SubmissionMode::Public` and `SubmissionMode::Private`)
- Marketplace export crate stub for future problem/solution repository
- Web wallet components for marketplace interactions

### Fixed
- **Critical Security Fix**: Epoch salt now correctly derived from parent block hash (`prev_hash`) instead of block height
  - Prevents pre-mining attacks where miners could compute problems before parent block exists
  - Ensures commit-mine-reveal protocol: `commitment = H(problem_params || parent_hash || H(solution))`
- Gossipsub mesh configuration optimized for small networks
  - Set `mesh_outbound_min=1`, `mesh_n_low=1`, `mesh_n=2`, `mesh_n_high=3`
  - Changed validation mode to `Permissive` for small network testing
  - Resolves "InsufficientPeers" errors in 2-node networks
- Fixed compilation error in `submit_problem` call to use `SubmissionMode::Public` wrapper
- Stale block prevention: Mining loop now checks if chain advanced before storing newly mined blocks

### Changed
- Updated network protocol to support small network deployments
- Enhanced block validation to use parent hash for epoch salt verification

### Technical Details
- **Epoch Salt Fix**: Changed from `Hash::new(&height.to_le_bytes())` to `prev_hash` in both `consensus/src/miner.rs` and `node/src/validator.rs`
- **Network Config**: Updated `network/src/protocol.rs` with optimized gossipsub parameters for 2-node networks
- **Marketplace**: Added support for both public (full problem visible) and private (commitment-only) problem submissions

## [4.5.0] - Previous Release

### Added
- Initial Network B implementation
- NP-hard problem solving (SubsetSum, SAT, TSP)
- Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) consensus
- Dimensional tokenomics (η = 1/√2)
- P2P networking with libp2p gossipsub
- Redb database for blockchain and state storage
